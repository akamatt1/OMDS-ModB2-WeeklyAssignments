    "By the way: why didn't I ask the question \"how can I check whether the customers all have unique AccountIDs\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem would be that Google and ChatGPT don't know what \"customers\" you are talking about.  It's important to understand that the AccountIDs are a column of a DataFrame, and as such they are a Series.  Therefore, we should use the correct vocabulary and ask about a Series.  If you mess up and ask about a \"list\" instead of a Series, you _might_ get an answer that still works.  But it's better to get the vocabularly right.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to add \"in python\" because this task could be performed in many languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT gave me this suggestion: data[data.isin(data[data.duplicated()])].iloc[0]\n",
    "However, ChatGPT did not explain how this code worked and even claimed (falsely) that it was going to use the value_counts() function in the solution.  So although the code is correct, I personally found ChatGPT's answer very confusing.  You could, perhaps, ask ChatGPT to explain further how this code works.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT, \"How does this code work: data[data.isin(data[data.duplicated()])].iloc[0]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Google leads me to the documentation for the duplicated() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.duplicated.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I can see that when I really need is data.duplicated(keep = False), where \"data\" should be the Series in question.  However, this just gives me a Series of boolean values indicating which ones are duplicates.  I have to somehow know that extracting the numerical values instead of a Series of booleans involves boolean indexing: data\\[data.duplicated(keep = False)].\n",
    "\n",
    "So as usual, I'd suggest that a combination of Google, documentation, and ChatGPT will give you the best information."

I don't expect you to spend an enormous amount of time on this; I understand that you likely will not have time to re-create every feature of the graph.  However, if you're excited about learning to use matplotlib, this is a good way to do that.  You don't have to duplicate the exact values on the graph; just the same rough shape will be enough.  If you don't feel comfortable using matplotlib yet, do the best you can and write down what you tried or what Google searches you did to find the answers."
