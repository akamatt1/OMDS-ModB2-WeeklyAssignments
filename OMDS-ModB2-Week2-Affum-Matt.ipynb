    "Data Storytelling Plan: Who, What, and How\n",
    "Based on the framework from Storytelling with Data and the insights extracted from the medical_insurance.csv dataset, here is the strategic plan for the explanatory analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. WHO\n",
    "The Audience:\n",
    "The Executive Benefits Committee of a mid-to-large-sized corporation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience Context:\n",
    "This group is responsible for the financial health of the company’s employee insurance plan. They are not data scientists; they are business leaders focused on \"bottom-line\" impact. They perceive health insurance as a necessary but rising cost. By being specific (targeting the Benefits Committee rather than \"the company\"), we can tailor the message to focus on cost-containment and long-term ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. WHAT\n",
    "The Action (What they should do):\n",
    "Approve a $50,000 pilot budget for a \"Corporate Wellness & Smoking Cessation Program\" starting in Q3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Communication Type & Tone:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: To persuade the committee that investing in preventative lifestyle programs will significantly reduce the number of high-cost insurance claimants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tone: Professional and evidence-based. It shifts the narrative from \"insurance is an uncontrollable expense\" to \"insurance costs are a manageable variable.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. HOW\n",
    "The Data as Evidence:\n",
    "To make this point effectively, I will use specific columns from the dataset to build the following case:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cost Gap (Smoking): Using the smoker and annual_medical_cost columns, I will show that a smoker costs the company an average of $4,295 annually, compared to $2,746 for a non-smoker. This $1,549 difference per employee is the \"price of inaction.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Risk Multiplier (BMI): I will use a scatter plot of bmi vs. annual_medical_cost. This will demonstrate that while high BMI increases costs, the combination of high BMI and smoking creates the most extreme financial outliers (the \"high-risk\" quadrant).\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing Context (The \"Nonsupporting\" Data): Following the book’s advice to avoid being misleading, I will also include data on age. While age also increases costs, it is a \"non-modifiable\" factor. By showing both, I can highlight that while we can't stop employees from getting older, we can help them stop smoking, which targets the most significant \"modifiable\" cost driver in our data."

I don't expect you to spend an enormous amount of time on this; I understand that you likely will not have time to re-create every feature of the graph. However, if you're excited about learning to use matplotlib, this is a good way to do that. You don't have to duplicate the exact values on the graph; just the same rough shape will be enough.  If you don't feel comfortable using matplotlib yet, do the best you can and write down what you tried or what Google searches you did to find the answers."

    "The Insight: While the \"Current Smoker\" group is the smallest of the three, it still represents over 12,000 individuals. For a wellness coordinator, this isn't just a \"small bar\" on a graph—it's a massive group of people whose healthcare costs are, on average, 56% higher than those who have never smoked. This visualization provides the \"Who\" for the intervention."
